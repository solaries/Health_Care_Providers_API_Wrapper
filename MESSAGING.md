Regarding the messages:

the NIP message title is not as specific as the KUDA message title. from the title i have a sort of full gist of what happened with my transaction. The first senetense of a the NIP message is confusing, a transaction is only successful if it took effect on both accounts. The rest of the NIP message is fine, as your customer you should put my mind to rest thatr you are working on the issue and would let me know when things are fine. The first sentence of the kuda message futher clarifys the issue. but the sentense talking about settlement partner might not be clear to some customers. I would go with a mix of the messages. It is very important to be clear when messaging / alerting customers and put their mind to rest as much as possible.
